Here's one project that I've done. It has a streamlit frontend, fastapi backend with hot reload for development purposes, nginx as a reverse proxy, and a.. SSH-tunnel container, that only starts a SSH-tunnel. It's basically a Dockerfile with a RSA-key. Extremely cursed, but this prevented my team from having to establish their own SSH-tunnel everytime they needed to connect to a remote server. The project also contains two LLM's, that are started on the server from a Dockerfile with the help of the CI/CD pipeline, but they're not in the docker-compose.



```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  streamlit:
    environment: 
      - APP_MODE=PRODUCTION
    build: ./streamlit_app
    volumes:
      - ./streamlit_app:/streamlit_app
    networks:
      - webnet

  fastapi:
    build: 
      context: .  # This should point to the root_directory
      dockerfile: api_service/Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./api_service:/app
    command: uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80 --reload # Add --reload for automatic reloading
    networks:
      - webnet

  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
      - "8000:80"
    volumes:
      - ./modules/nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf:ro
    depends_on:
      - streamlit
      - fastapi
    networks:
      - webnet

  ssh_tunnel:
    build: ./ssh
    networks:
